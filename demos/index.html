<h1>Gamedev Canvas Content Kit</h1>
<h2>Demos with the source code available for every step</h2>

<p>This Content Kit is based on the workshop materials available at <a href="http://breakout.enclavegames.com/">breakout.enclavegames.com</a> and hosted on <a href="https://github.com/end3r/Gamedev-Canvas-workshop">GitHub</a>. The latest set of demos can be found there, but they are also stored in this Content Kit as a backup, so you don't have to download multiple resources for your talk or workshop.</p>

<p>Here's the list of the code examples:</p>
