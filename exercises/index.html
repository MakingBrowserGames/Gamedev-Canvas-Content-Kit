<h2>Exercises extending functionality of the demos</h2>

<p>The exercises listed below are also present at the end of every lesson in the <a href="https://end3r.github.io/Gamedev-Canvas-Content-Kit/tutorial/">tutorial</a> and can be completed either by using the JSFiddles in the related lessons or by editing the <a href="https://end3r.github.io/Gamedev-Canvas-Content-Kit/demos/">demos</a> directly.</p>

<p>Here's the list of exercises:</p>
