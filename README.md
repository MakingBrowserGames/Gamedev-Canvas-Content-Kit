Gamedev Canvas Content Kit
===================

_Current as of March 28th 2015_

Introduction
------------

It's a collection of materials about game development in JavaScript. It was created based on the workshop materials about the MDN Breakout game written in pure JavaScript and rendered on Canvas.

Prepared by Andrzej Mazur who can provide feedback, training, answer questions and help preparing for the presentation.

Key Points
----------

1. Learn how to start with game development from scratch, start with the basics using pure JavaScript.

2. Focus on desktop explaining the HTML and JavaScript syntax and rendering on the Canvas element.

3. It's a good starting point before learning game development using frameworks. Mastering the logic of the small, simple 2D game is important before diving into more complicated concepts, tools, or 3D games.

4. Can also be used as the base for the gamedev workshop. The technology has settled, those basics should be actual for the next months and even years.

Presentation Setup and Materials
--------------------------------

For __any presentation__:

- [ ] No particular requirements, just a decent browser to launch the demo/samples.

Demoing: Things that are Broken
-------------------------------

As mentioned before, the technology is ready for some time now, so there shouldn't be any problems demoing it.

Demoing: The Good Parts
-----------------------

Perfect material for demoing - you'd have to use IE6 to have issues. Everything should be stable and running without any problems.

### Live-coding the game

Chose this option to challenge yourself and build the fully-working demo on your own, on the stage. Warning: live-coding ALWAYS causes problems - you'll forget about the semicolon, will mistakenly delete the closing bracket, the browser or the editor will freeze or something like that. You're doing that on your own risk.

You can live-code the game in your favourite editor and show the results locally in the browser.

### Showcasing next steps with small samples of the source code

Secure way to present the topic as everything is under control. Introduce the Canvas element, show the initial piece of code you're gonna expand and then present the next logical steps when building the demo game: drawing on the Canvas, movement, collision detection etc.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
---------------------------------

### Should I start from scratch or use a framework?

It depends on whether you already know JavaScript and want to build the game quickly, or wanna learn about the basics with a simple 2D game. In the second case - start from scratch.
