<h1>Gamedev Canvas Content Kit</h1>
<h2>Live-coding session</h2>

<p>Chose this option to challenge yourself and build the fully-working demo on your own, on the stage. <strong>Warning:</strong> live-coding ALWAYS causes problems - you'll forget about the semicolon, will mistakenly delete the closing bracket, the browser or the editor will freeze or something like that. You're doing that on your own risk.</p>

<p>You can live-code the game in your favourite editor and show the results locally in the browser, or use the JSFiddle for that:</p>

<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://jsfiddle.net/end3r/3x5foxb1/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>

<p>Introduce the Canvas element, show the initial piece of code you're gonna expand and then present the next logical steps when building the demo game: drawing on the Canvas, movement, collision detection etc. Help yourself with the <a href="https://end3r.github.io/Gamedev-Canvas-Content-Kit/tutorial/">tutorial</a> articles to master the flow if needed.</p>

<p>If you're unsure if you want to do live-coding on stage you can pick the usual approach with the <a href="https://end3r.github.io/Gamedev-Canvas-Content-Kit/slides/snippets/">slides containing code snippets</a> and do that instead. It's the secure way to present the topic as everything is under control.</p>
